# üèÅ Windows

## First things first...

* Make sure you have at least 20 GB of space free on your hard drive.
* You'll need to be on a 64-bit operating system to clone and build Dot Browser \(you can [check here](https://superuser.com/a/1225322/1083268)\).
* The following software and tools are required for the build process:
  * Git \([git-scm.org](https://git-scm.org)\)
  * Mercurial \([mercurial-scm.org](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)\)
  * python3 \([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\)
  * python2 \([python.org](https://python.org)\)
  * git-cinnabar \([github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/\#setup](https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/#setup)\)
  * Visual Studio \([visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)\)
* Select the following settings in Visual Studio Installer:
  * Desktop development with C++
  * Game development with C++
  * Windows 10 SDK \(version **10.0.17134.0 or higher**\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Dot Browser is based on Firefox, which is why it is referenced a lot in the build process.

We're doing work on the Windows builds behind the scenes. Stay tuned.
