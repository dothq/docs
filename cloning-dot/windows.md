  popular operating system, Windows.
---

# üèÅ Windows

## First things first...

* Minimum requirements:

  * 8GB of RAM
  * 4 physical CPU cores
  * 20GB of disk space free

* Recommended requirements:

  * 16GB of RAM
  * 8 physical CPU cores
  * 35GB of disk space free

* You'll need to be on a 64-bit operating system to clone and build Dot Browser.

  * [Don't know if your computer is 64-bit?](https://superuser.com/questions/251014/how-do-i-check-whether-my-hardware-is-64-bit-capable-in-windows/1225322#1225322)

* The following software and tools are required for the build process:

  * Git \([git-scm.org](https://git-scm.org)\)
  * NodeJS \([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)\)
  * yarn \([npmjs.com/package/yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)\)
  * Docker
  * MozillaBuild
  * Visual Studio \([visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)\)

* Select the following settings in Visual Studio Installer:
  * Desktop development with C++
  * Game development with C++
  * Windows 10 SDK \(version **10.0.17134.0 or higher**\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Dot Browser is based on Firefox, which is why it is referenced a lot in the build process.
{% endhint %}

## Installing MozillaBuild

You will need to use MozillaBuild for some parts of this.

To install,[ download the latest version of MozillaBuild](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe). And then run the installer.

## Clone the repository

We're now going to clone Dot Browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dothq/browser-ff
```

Or if you prefer using GitLab:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/dothq/browser-ff
```

After the clone is complete, you'll want to enter the `browser-ff` directory.

### Downloading the source code and mounting

Now run `./melon download` This will download the source code.

{% hint style="info" %}
`melon` is a build toolkit for Dot Browser.
{% endhint %}

## Importing the patches

Once you've downloaded the source code, you're going to want to import the patches. You can do this by running the command below.

```bash
./melon import
```

If everything went smoothly with the import, you should see a "success" message.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you see an error saying that a patch failed due to different line endings, run `./melon fix-le` and try again.
{% endhint %}

## Building Dot Browser

Now, we're going to want to build Dot Browser for Windows.

It's a very resource intensive process so make sure you check the requirements against your computer. It usually takes between 30 minutes and an hour for computers meeting the recommended requirements.

```bash
cd src
MOZCONFIG=../configs/windows/mozconfig ./mach build
```

Once the build is done, we need to make sure the build was successful. Check to see if something appeared like:

```text
01:00:00 Your build was successful!
```

If you see that message, you can move on to the final step.

## Running Dot Browser

The final step is to run your locally-built version of Dot Browser.

It's as simple as entering the `src` folder and running:

```bash
./mach run
```

And voil√†, Dot should appear before your eyes!

The Windows build process is still a work-in-progress. If you encounter any issues, please [open an issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dothq/browser/issues/new/choose).
