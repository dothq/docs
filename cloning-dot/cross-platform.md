## Building Dot Browser

Now, we're going to want to build Dot Browser for your target OS.

See [Supported build targets](cross-platform.md#supported-build-targets) for a list of supported build targets.

 It's a very resource intensive process so make sure you check the requirements against your computer. It usually takes 30 minutes for computers in the recommended requirements region.

```bash
./melon build <target-os> # target-os could be: windows, macos or linux
```

Once the build is done, we need to make sure the build was successful, check to see if something appeared like:

```text
01:00:00 Your build was successful!
```

If you see that message, you can move on to the final step.
